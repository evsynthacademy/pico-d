## Studies to supplement your systematic review

<br>

In an ideal world, you’d have enough Randomized Controlled Trials to answer your research question. In the real world, you work with the evidence that’s available. Here are some study designs that might help you fill in the gaps of your research:

**Non-comparative research**: this is a broad category, describing any type of study that doesn’t compare an intervention group with a control group. In other words, the research explores what happens to patients who receive a certain treatment without comparing them to patients who didn’t receive the treatment or had a different type of medical care.  

**Types of non-comparative research include**:

- **Case series**: which describe the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and follow up for a group of patients who all have the same exposure or treatment.
- **Case reports**: which tell the detailed story of an individual patient, describing that person’s symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Case reports often describe situations that are rare or unexpected. 

**When to include case studies/reports**: These studies could be useful if you’re interested in safety issues or a rare condition/outcome. Although case reports don’t offer a comparison with other interventions, they can give you insight into the safety of a specific treatment. 

Now that you know about all of your study options, it’s time to choose the study types you want to include in your systematic review.
