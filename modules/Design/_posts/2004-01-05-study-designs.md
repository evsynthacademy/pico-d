## Pick Your Study Designs

<br>

What types of studies will help you answer your question?  Remember, you want to know:

How does peritoneal dialysis compare with hemodialysis with regards to 6 month mortality following the start of dialysis for adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease?

How does peritoneal dialysis compare with hemodialysis with regards to infection rates 6 months after the start of dialysis for adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease?

Remember, ideally, you’d only include studies at the top of the hierarchy of evidence. Of those, which fit the needs of your systematic review? 


<form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
  <input type="checkbox" name="RCT" value="started"> <b>Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)  </b> This is the gold standard for research, so you’ll want to use any RCTs that fit our question. <br><br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="SR" value="st" > <b>Cohort Studies</b> These could be useful for information about the long term safety of each kidney failure intervention. 
<br><br>
You may find that there are very few RCTs addressing your question; patients (and clinicians) are rarely willing to chose their dialysis option based on a roll of the dice. So, you might have to rely on cohort studies to address your question.<br><br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="SR" value="knowledge" > <b>Case-control studies</b>   Probably not useful for this question. You’re not looking for the cause of kidney failure. You’re trying to compare two types of treatment. <br> <br>
</form>



Ok, let’s say you need some more evidence to explore your question. Are any non-comparative studies useful for this systematic review?

#### Non- comparative studies


<form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
  <input type="checkbox" name="case_series" value="started"> <b>Case series  </b> These studies don’t offer a comparison between treatments, so they’re not useful for your review.  You might consider using case series only If you don’t have enough evidence about the outcomes for your intervention or your comparator. <br><br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="case_reports" value="st" > <b>Case Reports </b> These studies aren’t useful because they only talk about an individual patient and offer no treatment comparisons. If you are really lacking evidence, perhaps if your outcomes are very rare, there’s a chance these individual stories could paint a fuller picture of the outcomes for either your intervention or your comparator.

You’ve picked your study designs so you’re done, right? Not so fast. You still have a few more choices to make.
