## Your ideal studies 

<br>

**Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** are generally thought of as the “gold standard” for comparative effectiveness research, when researchers are comparing interventions. In RCTs, participants of similar characteristics are randomly placed in either an intervention or a control group. The study then evaluates and compares the outcomes between the two groups. 

**When to include**: In most cases, if RCTs exist for your question, you’ll want to use them in your systematic review. They’re especially useful for questions comparing the effectiveness of different treatment approaches. If the study includes follow up with participants, it can also help you examine questions related to safety. 


**Cohort studies** examine the outcomes of a condition by looking forward. Researchers start with two groups: those who are exposed to a potential risk factor or intervention and those who are not. Then researchers follow those groups over time to compare what happens. 

**When to include**: Cohort studies are useful if your question involves knowing about the long term safety of an intervention. These studies can also be useful for effectiveness and exposure related research if you can’t find useful RCTs. 

**Case-control studies** examine the association between outcomes and potential risk factors by looking backwards. Researchers start with two groups of people: those with and those without a condition/disease.  Researchers then use information on how often each group was exposed to the potential cause of the condition/disease in the past to see if there’s a connection between the amount of exposure and the presence of the condition/disease. 

**When to include**: We don’t often use case-control studies in systematic reviews, but they can be useful if your question is about how people with a given (usually rare) condition or exposure relate to those without that condition or exposure. Some diagnostic test studies also use the case-control design. 

RCTs, cohort studies and case-control studies are among the most useful study designs for systematic reviews. But what if these studies aren’t available, or maybe there aren’t enough of these types of studies to do a comprehensive analysis? That’s when you go further down the pyramid of evidence.
