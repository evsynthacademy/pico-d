## Design

<br>
 
Design is the next factor to consider when you’re writing your question. Design is a little different from the other aspects of PICO because you don’t usually include this information in your actual question, but it’s a crucial part of the research strategy. You’ll usually see the design portion of PICO (D) described in a systematic review’s inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Basically, you need to specify the design, or the types of studies, you want to include in your systematic review.  

In this section of the course, you’ll learn about the types of studies that can help you answer your question.  (For more detailed descriptions of your study design options, take a look at this course.)
