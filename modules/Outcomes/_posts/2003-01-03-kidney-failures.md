## Kidney Failure Outcomes

<br>
 
If you were conducting an actual systematic review, you’d take a close look at existing research on kidney disease, familiarize yourself with key outcomes, and decide which of these were most important for your research interests. 

For the sake of this exercise, you’re going to choose two clinical outcomes: short-term mortality (did the patient survive for 6 months after the start of dialysis?) and a specific short-term morbidity (did the patient develop infections during the 6 months after the start of dialysis?)

Here’s the revised question, now broken into two parts to integrate those outcomes:

To review, your question now addresses:

- **P**opulation: Adults diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease
- **I**ntervention: Peritoneal dialysis
- **C**omparator: Hemodialysis
- **O**utcomes: 6 month mortality and 6 month infection rates following start of dialysis

Next, you’ll address the last category in the PICO (D) approach: **Design**.
