## Intervention + Comparator Details

<br>
 
You’ve identified your intervention and what you’re comparing it to, but you need to be more specific about those interventions. Are you comparing one round of hemodialysis to one round of peritoneal dialysis? Or are you looking at treatments over the course of several months? More than a year?

You don’t need this level of detail in your question, but your research plan should be specific about: doses, durations, and the methods for delivering both your intervention and your comparator.

So far, you’ve included the **Population**, **Intervention** and **Comparator** in your question:

- **P**opulation: Adults diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease
- **I**ntervention: Peritoneal dialysis
- **C**omparator: Hemodialysis

Next, you’ll pick the **Outcomes** you want to include to evaluate the intervention and the comparator.
