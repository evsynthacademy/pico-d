## What are you comparing?

<br>

The comparison in your question can be specific or general. For example, do you want to know if Drug A is more effective than Drug B, or if medical therapy is more effective than surgery in general? 

In the case of stage 5 chronic kidney disease, the main treatment options are kidney transplant, peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. 

For the purposes of this course, let’s compare peritoneal dialysis (the intervention) with hemodialysis (the comparator). 

Here’s the revised version of the original question:

What’s the best way to manage  How does peritoneal dialysis (intervention) compare with hemodialysis (comparator) for adults with stage 5 chronic kidney disease?

Note that this formulation of the research question is neutral in regards to whether peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis may be better. This is much prefered to the more biased way of asking the same question: Is peritoneal dialysis better than hemodialysis for adults with stage 5 CKD? The latter question suggests that the researchers are biased toward peritoneal dialysis.

You’re almost done with the intervention and comparator. One the next page, you’ll consider a few last details.
