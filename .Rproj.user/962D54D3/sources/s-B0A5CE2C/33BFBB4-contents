## Meet PICO(D)

<br>

Well-developed research questions include elements of what we will call **PICO(D)**. 

**PICO** stands for:

**Population**: What specific people or conditions are you researching?

**Interventions**: (Exposure): What treatments, diagnostic tests, or other interventions or exposures are you studying? 

This could be a treatment like a new drug or cancer therapy, an exposure like asbestos or cigarette smoke, a device like a prosthetic limb, a diagnostic test like chest radiography, or a predictor/characteristic like age or family history.

**Comparators**: What are you comparing this intervention or exposure to? 

This may be placebo or no treatment, or current usual care like talk therapy, or alternative interventions of interest like calcium channel blockers versus beta blockers.

**Outcomes**: What measures or events are you using to evaluate the intervention?  

The **(D)** stands for **Design**: What types of studies should be included to evaluate the interventions and outcomes? 

Depending on the overall research question and the likely availability of evidence, these may be randomized controlled trials, any comparative studies, single group studies, database or registry analyses, prospective or retrospective studies, case series and reports, and others. 


Some researchers use **(TS)** instead of **(D)** to stand for **T**iming (or follow-up duration) and Setting. Either way, the basic idea is the same. You use this step to describe the kind of studies you want to include in your systematic review. 

In this course, we’ll start with a broad question and use PICO(D) to transform it into a well-formulated question that will guide our search for appropriate evidence. So, let’s get started.
