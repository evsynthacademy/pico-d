## Report your findings

<br>

This is the final step. Once you’ve drawn conclusions based on the evidence, you write a clear narrative of the steps you took and what you discovered. 

If you’re reading a systematic review, you should know that different types of reports offer different levels of detail. For instance, journal articles are typically briefer than technical reports. A journal’s website, a company’s report, or a government agency’s technical documents may have supplementary table and figures you can use if you’re looking for more information. 


For more details about the steps of a systematic review, you can check out our courses on  How to Conduct a Systematic Review. 

For now, let’s look at how the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health (CESH) has used systematic reviews to answer important clinical questions.
