# Course Description


Statistical computing is an essential part of analysis. Statisticians need not only be able to run existing computer software but understand how that software functions. Students will learn fundamental concepts - Data Management, Data types, Data cleaning and manipulation, databases, graphics, functions, loops, simulation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo through working with various statistical analysis. Students will learn to write code in an organized fashion with comments. This course will use a variety of web-based material from:


- [php2560.com](http://php2560.com)
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/1118)
- [rstudio.sullivanstatistics.com](https://rstudio.sullivanstatistics.com)
- [Github](https://www.github.com)

# Course Format


This course will be taught in a "flipped" format. Students will watch a series of videos and work through some simple coding examples before coming to class.  The sequence of these will be displayed on the course website as well as a calendar for which videos need to be watched prior to attending class. 

The classroom format will focus on labs and projects. You will be involved with computing and coding on a regular basis. Labs will form into projects which you will finish outside of class and turn in for grading. 


# Flipped Format and References


We need to take some time to discuss what it means to have a flipped format class. In this style of formatting the note taking portion of the course will be done via videos. Think of these as video textbooks in which you gather the basic details before practicing the material. 

In the traditional format this course would have the instructor teaching 160 minutes a week with some hands on lab activities but most coding work done outside of class. In the flipped format you will have access to these lectures as your work prior to class. You then will have 180 minutes of hands on coding projects, code sharing and time with the instructor. 

This course will utilize a wealth of materials from many different resources aside from the textbooks:

- The majority of R videos will be hosted by \href{www.datacamp.com}{https://www.datacamp.com/courses/1118} and created by the instructor. 
- Some notes have been adapted from:
    - Shalizi, C. R. and Thomas, A. C. (2014), [Statistical Computing 36-350: Beginning to Advanced Techniques in R](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/statcomp/14)



- Shiny is a product of R Studio and will be presented by RStudio with example created by the last 2 classes PHP 2560 class and the instructor. 






# Prerequisites

Students should have courses in probability and statistical inference at the level of PHP 1510 or PHP 2510.

2. Complete all assigned flipped material *prior* to coming to class and be prepared to work on in class lab. 
3. Complete and turn in all assignments on time. All assignments will be graded on ability of code to work, quality of coding and quality of comments on code. 
4. Demonstrate an understanding on material on all projects.  
5. Respect each other, each others questions and each others discussion. 
6. Peer review other students code.

# Differences between PHP 1560/2560

Given the nature of this course with multiple levels of students from Undergraduate to PhD, it is important to discuss the differences of expectations and how students will be graded. 


## Undergraduates

-------------------------------------------------
Grade Category          Comments
---------------------- ---------------------------------
Participation          Graded the same as all students, Must be in class and prepared to work in groups. 

Pre-Class Assignments  Students will be expected to complete a portion of the material with the exception of some more difficult problems which may be attempted but do not have to be complete. Peer Review will be the same. 

In-Class Projects      Students will work on the same projects that all other students work on. They will be placed in groups with other students but will not be expected to contribute the same level of coding as graduate students.       

R Package              Students will build an R package. Functions may be basic or simple given the amount of statistics taken by this point in time.

Shiny App              Shiny app coding as well as end result will be at an appropriate level for the understanding of statistics and data analysis of the students. 
--------------------------------------------------



\newpage

## Graduate Students



-------------------------------------------------
Grade Category          Comments
---------------------- ---------------------------------
Participation          Graded the same as all students, Must be in class and prepared to work in groups. 

Pre-Class Assignments  Students will be expected to complete all parts of the assignments. Peer reviews will be thorough and well critiqued.  

In-Class Projects      Students will work on the same projects that all other students work on. It is expected that graduate students will contribute more coding to the projects as well as leadership.        

R Package              Students will build an R package. Functions are expected to be useful to the area of statistics students are working in. Graduate students will be expected to have more challenging methods and data incorporated into their R package. 

Shiny App              Shiny app coding as well as end result will be at an appropriate level for the understanding of statistics and data analysis of the students. 
--------------------------------------------------

## Evaluation Category Details


### Participation

Participation will be calculated by the successful completion of videos and practice coding done prior to class as well as being present and engaged during the in class portion. 

With the class meeting once a week it is crucial that all students attend. Any student who needs to miss a class must inform the instructor by 9 am the morning of the class. Unexcused absences will result in a 5% reduction in overall course grade.  

### Pre-Class Assignments

At the end of the videos each week a preview of the in class lab will need to be completed. This will ensure that all students are prepared to work on the material in the lab. Once this assignment is turned in, each student will be required to peer review code of a number of other students. Code will be graded and commented on based on criteria given out in class. Each students grade will be a combination of there own work as well as their peer reviewing of other students code. 



### In-Class Project

Projects will be a culmination of in class labs with some extra parameters associated with them. Most of the work on Projects will be done in groups

### R Package

Another useful skill with R is to take methods, data or other user created tools and turn them into a package. Students will work in groups to create an R Package as directed by the instructor. 


### Shiny App

An important part of statistics is the visualization and representation of data. Students will be expected to code and build their own Shiny Apps.
